[gomez]

  [smcmahon]

- Fix superlance use tests for RedHat.
  [smcmahon]

  [smcmahon]

  This should not affect existing Plone 4.x installs.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.17 2017-05-11

- Add option to set backup post_command: plone_backup_post_command.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.16 2017-04-19

- setuptools 35.0.0 changes the way manifests are handled, causing .xml files to be lost in installation of several packages.
  Introduced a mechanism to set the setuptools and zc.buildout versions. Set working defaults.
  Version variables work globally or in particular instances.
  New variables and their defaults are plone_setuptools_version: '26.1.1' and plone_zc_buildout_version: '2.5.3'.
  [smcmahon]

  [MrTango]

1.2.15 2017-02-01

- Redirect stdout and stderr for buildout into a log file.
  This works around an Ansible bug that caused errors with misleading error messages if buildout output was long.
  Workaround: if you don't have this fix, just run the playbook again.
  The error resolves itself as soon as buildout output is smaller.
  [smcmahon]

  This only matters for tests.
  [smcmahon]

- The way we use become_user is problematic for Ansible 2.1 unless pipelining is in use.
  Set pipelining on in defaults.

- Do our best to detect changes in files copied via plone_buildout_extra_dir. Fixes #70.
  [smcmahon]

- Add plone_install_zeoserver and plone_zeo_ip. Together, these make it possible to use the role for cluster configurations.

  [smcmahon]

- Make cronjob notifications via email more useful.

  [jpgimenez]

- Relicense as BSD-3-Clause.
