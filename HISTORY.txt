1.3.8 (unreleased)

- Make it a little easier to use Vagrant to test against playbooks other than test.yml by
  1) having the Vagrantfile not automatically provision with ansible; and
  2) adding a couple of shell scripts to test against the default or all boxes.
  Both shell scripts accept a test playbook filename; if none is given, runs against test.yml.
  Note that Travis CI only tests ./test.yml.
  [smcmahon]

- Fix CI by updating .travis to use bionic and --become rather than --sudo.
  [smcmahon]

- Earlier buildout fix in this release introduced a typo that broke buildout operation under some conditions. Fixed.
  [smcmahon]

- Bump superlance to v1.0 to support Python 3
  [stevepiercy]

- Buildout would not be re-run even when the buildout template had changed.  Fixed.
  [fulv]

1.3.7 2019-07-21

- Make it possible to use Python 3 with Plone 5.2.
  Allow plone_python_version to be set generally or per plone server.
  Expand test.yml to include both 2.7 and 3 builds of Plone 5.2.
  [smcmahon]

1.3.6 2019-03-25

- Add Plone 5.2 to test suite.
  It's working with Python 2.7 for RC2-pending.
  [smcmahon]

- Do not specify the products folder in buildout config for Plone 5.2+.
  It's no longer supported.
  [smcmahon]

- By default, try to download a requirements.txt from dist.plone.org.
  If that doesn't work (e.g., for older Plone versions), fall back to our previous strategy of creating one from an included template.
  The requirements.txt is used via pip to prime the virtualenv prior to running buildout.
  [smcmahon]

- Default Plone version -> 5.1.4.
  [smcmahon]

- Update use of "apt" for Debian to avoid with_items, which has been deprecated for package handling.
  [smcmahon]

1.3.5 2018-09-25

- memmon's supervisor configuration failed if memmon wasn't on a particular path. Fixed.
  [smcmahon]

- 1.3.4's fix for configuration of tcpcheck port broke if client count wasn't specified in the individual config.
  Fixed.
  [smcmahon]

1.3.4 2018-09-24

- Fix tcpchecks in test.yml.
  [smcmahon]

- superlance was needlessly installed even if plone_hot_monitor was set to 'cron'.
  Harmless, but untidy.
  [smcmahon]

- Automated configuration of the tcp check port wasn't working for multiple plones.
  Deliberately specified ports on a plone-by-plone level was working.
  Fixed.

- Switch to platform virtualenv broke use of memmon in some environments. Fixed.
  [smcmahon]

1.3.3 2018-08-24

- Switch to using platform virtualenv whenever available.
  Then, use requirements.txt method for updating pip, setuptools, zc.buildout.
  [smcmahon]

- Drop Trusty and CentOS7 from tested environments. i
  They no longer have Pythons current enough for Plone 5.1.x.
  (They're still fine for earlier versions of Plone.)
  [smcmahon]

1.3.2 2018-05-21

- Add FreeBSD support, targetting 11.
  Generalize supervisor setup to make this a bit easier.
  [smcmahon]

- Update Ansible version requirement to 2.5.0.
  Complementary fix for issue #112 from ansible_playbook.
  [smcmahon]

1.3.1 2018-05-04

- Normalize tests to use "is" rather than jinja2 filter.
  Use "version" rather than "version_compare".
  [smcmahon]

- Use lynx rather than lynx-curr package on debian. lynx-curr has disappeared on bionic.
  Use bionic64 as first test vagrant box.
  We are now working on bionic.
  [smcmahon]

- Update to Plone 5.1.1 as default.
  [smcmahon]

- Switch to using launchpad.net for buildout-cache tarball downloads. Avoid timeouts from dist.plone.org.
  [smcmahon]

1.3.0 2018-03-10

    **Before you update***: If you're using version 1.2.x, you should note that version 1.3.0+ sets up client monitors for each ZEO client.
    These monitors will use the client port + 100.
    haproxy will use these monitor ports as a mechanism to check ZEO client status without using an http thread.
     See ``tcpcheck`` variables in the documentation for plone setup if you wish to alter or turn off this feature.

- Use five.z2monitor facilities to configure health check ports.
  plone_client_tcpcheck and plone_client_tcpcheck_port control this.
  See http://hvelarde.blogspot.com/2017/12/we-have-been-doing-health-checks-wrong.html for an excellent writeup on why this is a much better idea than http checks.
  Thanks, hvelarde!
  [smcmahon]

1.2.25 2018-03-06

- Update to use Plone 5.1.0 as default.

1.2.24 2018-02-27

  [smcmahon]

1.2.23 2018-02-20

- Add plone_zodb_cache_size_bytes setting.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.22 2017-12-12

- Update and clean up hotfixes.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.20 2017-11-12

  We need to know if that breaks.
  [smcmahon]

- Change wv rpm URL for Centos7
  [l00ptr]

1.2.19 2017-10-29

  [gomez]

- Custom backup paths were not working. Fix that and add some test coverage.
  [smcmahon]

- Fix superlance use tests for RedHat.
  [smcmahon]

- Fix test "post" backup command.
  [smcmahon]

- Remove bootstrap.py in the Plone 4.x install and instead use a buildout created by installing zc.buildout in the virtualenv.
  bootstrap.py was already unused in the Plone 5.x install.
  This should not affect existing Plone 4.x installs.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.17 2017-05-11

- Add option to set backup post_command: plone_backup_post_command.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.16 2017-04-19

- setuptools 35.0.0 changes the way manifests are handled, causing .xml files to be lost in installation of several packages.
  Introduced a mechanism to set the setuptools and zc.buildout versions. Set working defaults.
  Version variables work globally or in particular instances.
  New variables and their defaults are plone_setuptools_version: '26.1.1' and plone_zc_buildout_version: '2.5.3'.
  [smcmahon]

- Add a "plone_timezone" variable that may be used to set a timezone (via TZ environment variable) that may be different from the server or other plones.
  [smcmahon]

- Timezone-setting mechanism wasn't working in Xenial.
  Fixed with a mechanism that should work on any system with timedatectl.
  [smcmahon]

- Add plone_hot_monitor variable to control use of superlance.
  [smcmahon]

  [smcmahon]

  buildout.cfg on the server. Also change the default to live.cfg,
  to avoid conflicts with local buildout.cfg files.
  [MrTango]

1.2.15 2017-02-01

- Redirect stdout and stderr for buildout into a log file.
  This works around an Ansible bug that caused errors with misleading error messages if buildout output was long.
  Workaround: if you don't have this fix, just run the playbook again.
  The error resolves itself as soon as buildout output is smaller.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.14 2017-01-20

- Remove uses of jinja2 "truncate", which has stopped working as advertised.

  [smcmahon]

- Default Vagrant box: trusty -> xenial.
  [smcmahon]

- Add a provisioning mechanism that creates vbox_host.cfg during vagrant provisioning.
  This makes it easier to use Ansible directly against the newer generation of Vagrant boxes that don't have insecure keys.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.11 2016-07-18

- Fix Bootstrap for 4.3 play, which was using the old path to Python.
  [djowett]

1.2.10 2016-07-18

  This only matters for tests.
  [smcmahon]

- The way we use become_user is problematic for Ansible 2.1 unless pipelining is in use.
  Set pipelining on in defaults.
  [smcmahon]

- Symbolic link to self for testing fouled up vagrant on platforms without client extensions.
  Change strategy to use ansible.cfg specification for roles.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.9 2016-07-08

  [smcmahon]

- Default to Plone 5.0.4.
  [smcmahon]

- Document several variables related to plone site creation. Fixes #74.
  [smcmahon]

1.2.7 2016-03-28

- Do our best to detect changes in files copied via plone_buildout_extra_dir. Fixes #70.
  [smcmahon]

- Add plone_install_zeoserver and plone_zeo_ip. Together, these make it possible to use the role for cluster configurations.
  [smcmahon]

- Eliminate needless stop of client1. This also makes the role work when plone_client_count is 0.
  [smcmahon]

- Make cronjob notifications via email more useful.
  [djowett]

- Add plone_rsync_backup_options to make backup more flexible.

  [jpgimenez]

- Relicense as BSD-3-Clause.
