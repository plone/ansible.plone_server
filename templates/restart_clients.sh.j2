# This performs a more-or-less graceful restart of zope clients.
# Strategy:
#   1) stop client; wait long enough that haproxy will have marked it down
#   2) start client; wait long enough for it to start listening
#   3) Fetch the homepage directly from the client to load the cache.
#      This will hopefully be the first request the client receives,
#      since haproxy shouldn't have marked it live yet.
#      So, when haproxy marks it live, the cache will be warm.
